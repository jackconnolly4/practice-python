# Write a program that stores a customer's age and a movie's time in two separate variables. Then calculate the price of a movie ticket based on the following conditions:

# If the age is 12 years old or younger, the ticket price is $5.
# If the age is between 13 and 59 years old and the movie is before 6 PM, the ticket price is $7. After 6 PM, the ticket price is $10.
# If the customer is 60 years old or older, the ticket price is $7.

# time = 8

#   price = 5

# Write a program to store the type of book (regular, reference, or special collection) and the number of days its overdue. Then calculate the fine amount based on the following conditions:

# If the book is a regular book and overdue by up to 7 days, the fine is $1 per day.
# If the book is a regular book and overdue by more than 7 days, the fine is $2 per day.
# If the book is a reference book, there is no fine, regardless of the number of days overdue.
# If the book is a special collection book, the fine is $5 per day, regardless of the number of days overdue.

# Write a program that stores a person's order value and membership level (regular or premium). Then calculate a discount amount based on the following conditions:

# If the total order value is less than $50, there is no discount.
# If the total order value is between $50 and $100, the discount is 5% for regular customers and 10% for premium customers.
# If the total order value is greater than $100, the discount is 10% for regular customers and 15% for premium customers.
